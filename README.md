## Contributing

node-appc is an open source project. node-appc wouldn't be where it is now without
contributions by the community. Please consider forking node-appc to improve,
enhance or fix issues. If you feel like the community will benefit from your

To protect the interests of the node-appc contributors, Appcelerator, customers
and end users we require contributors to sign a Contributors License Agreement
(CLA) before we pull the changes into the main repository. Our CLA is simple and
straightforward - it requires that the contributions you make to any
Appcelerator open source project are properly licensed and that you have the
legal authority to make those changes. This helps us significantly reduce future
legal risk for everyone involved. It is easy, helps everyone, takes only a few
minutes, and only needs to be completed once.

[You can digitally sign the CLA](http://bit.ly/app_cla) online. Please indicate
your email address in your first pull request so that we can make sure that will
locate your CLA.  Once you've submitted it, you no longer need to send one for
subsequent submissions.
